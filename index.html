                    <p>
                        Here are some of the pieces of literature that I looked at during the process of making this webpage.
                        There's a lot of intermix between the academic and "ordinary" literature should be expected because the two are interconnected.
                        Literature written for a general audience provides us with insights on what it feels like to be at the speartip of the event;
                        literature aimed towards academics provides us with more nuanced information and the framework for meta-analysis to arise and draw, predict conclusions from.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, some of these references might not be available to everyone because of their academic nature.
                        I strongly encourage those who're able to view these guarded resources to take a peek at them because they're very insightful and interesting.
                    </p>

                        Hopefully this webpage will help inspire you, the reader, to engage a little more in working condition disputes.
                        We all deserve to be represented with dignity while we work.
